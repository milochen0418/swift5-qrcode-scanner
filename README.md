Swift QRCode scanner is made by Simon Ng on 13/10/2016.    
I download it from https://github.com/Hopsken/DaysOfSwift/.   
Then I fixed the scanner source code to support swift 5 in 2020.  

Right now, the code can support for barcode scanner and QRCode scanner together. 

# App Store
The code is release on App Store.  
You can download it and test it directly.
